# Shape-Shooter-with-OpenGL

This project is a twist on the classic archery game where user has to complete 3 different levels. To make this project more interesting, the number of maximum moves for each level are fixed. Winning the game is only possible if you use the most optimized moves. This project is made using OpenGL which includes all the basic library functions. There are infinite invisible arrows and a moving platform to shoots, through which the target block is destroyed.

## The main objectives of our project are:
Showcase the use of OpenGL to make interactive user game
Illustrating the keyboard interaction.
To provide entertainment to the user
